# MTDSim
Making alterations to MTDSim based on Wenxiao's Proposal:

### Setup
This was all run on Python 3.9.13 64 Bit. In the root directory in terminal, run the following commands in your virtual environment to setup the environment:
 - python setup.py install
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - python -m mtdnetwork.run -m IPShuffle -n 50 -e 10 -s 5 -l 3  results.json

The following is only an example of how the function can be made, reference the run.py file or use the â€“help command to understand the parameters.
### Architecture
The system uses the 3-layer HARM model to represent the network. This is a representation of the network, with the lowest levels on the bottom and the highest levels on the top:

| layer           | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network         | Made up of all the Hosts, connected in an Attack Graph, with exposed and un-exposed hosts that attackers will attempt to compromise      |
| Host            | Made up of several services (internal and external) in an Attack Graph.  The host is compromised when an internal service is compromised |
| Services        | An attack tree of vulnerabilities. A service is compromised when  the sum of the vulnerabilities exploited impact is above 7             |
| Vulnerabilities | Generated with a set Attack Complexity and Impact                                                                                        |
