# MTDSimTime

A research project on the simulation and evaluation of moving target defense in the time domain.

## Setup this project

1. Installing [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. Creating conda environment
   - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activating the environment
   - `conda activate mtdsimtime`
4. Updating the environment
   - `conda env update --name mtdsimtime --file environment.yml --prune`
5. Running an example:
   - [data_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/data_analysis.ipynb)
   - [simulation.ipynb](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/simulation.ipynb)
6. Still developing.....


## Progresses

1. set up new discrete event simulation structure:
    - get rid of the original `ActionManager` based structure
    - use [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to manage the time simulation, event processing, interaction (interruption)
    - use [time generator](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/operation/time_generator.py) to generate exponential/normal/uniform/weibull/poisson variate

2. set up new mtd action flow in [mtd_operation](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/operation/mtd_operation.py):
    - introduce resource occupation mechanism:
        - MTD fetch resource when it executes, release resource when it completes
        - each resource has a `capacity` parameter (default=1) represents the number of available resource in the network.
        - two types of resource: network / application
            - network: [completetopologyshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/completetopologyshuffle.py), [hosttoplogyshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/hosttopologyshuffle.py), [ipshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/ipshuffle.py)
            - application: [osdiversity](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/osdiversity.py), [portshuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/portshuffle.py), [servicediversity](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/servicediversity.py)
            - reserve: [usershuffle](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/mtd/usershuffle.py) (_todo_)
    - interrupt attack process:
        - network MTD operation: any attack action -> scan_host
        - application MTD operation: (scan_port, exploit_vuln, brute_force) -> scan_port
    -

3. Rework the attack profile to facilitate `SimPy` framework ([hacker](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/New-Attack-Method/mtdnetwork/hacker.py) -> [adversary](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/blob/main/mtdnetwork/network/adversary.py))
    - scan_host: merged start network enum and set up host enum
    - enum_host: merged start host enum and process host enum
    - scan_port: merged port scan and check pass reuse 
    - exploit_vuln: merged find and exploit vulns
    - brute_force: merged start and process brute force
    - scan_neighbor: merged start and set up new neighbors
    

4. Implement snapshot mechanism to save the state of the network object and the adversary object. Restrictions with generator object issues:
    - cannot save and maintain generator object generated by SimPy when saving
    - **solution**: [snapshot saving](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/snapshot) [operation](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/operation)
      - extract mtd_operation object from network object to handle state saving for network object
      - extract attack_operation object from adversary object to handle state saving for adversary object
      - introduce SnapshotCheckpoint to save and load files based on simulation time.

5. Refactor [data collection and analysis behaviours](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/stats)

6. implement three [MTD Schemes](https://github.com/MoeBuTa/MTDSimTime/tree/main/mtdnetwork/network/mtd_scheme): simultaneously, randomly, alternatively.

7. implement Mean Time to Compromise.

8. implement MTD Execute Frequency.


## Todos / Future works
### Time related
 - assign mean/std/distribution of each time variable based on system properties, sensitivity analysis, empirical data (currently is randomly assigned)
 - more time based evaluation metrics

### MTD related
1. defense metrics (implement QOS)
2. reconfiguration limit
   - dynamic MTD
   - resource capacity (1 or more)
   - system state
3. AI


### Attack related
1. Attack metrics
2. multiple attackers
3. 



## System Architecture
The system uses the 3-layer HARM model to represent the network. This is a representation of the network, with the lowest levels on the bottom and the highest levels on the top:

| layer           | Description                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network         | Made up of all the Hosts, connected in an Attack Graph, with exposed and un-exposed hosts that attackers will attempt to compromise      |
| Host            | Made up of several services (internal and external) in an Attack Graph.  The host is compromised when an internal service is compromised |
| Services        | An attack tree of vulnerabilities. A service is compromised when  the sum of the vulnerabilities exploited impact is above 7             |
| Vulnerabilities | Generated with a set Attack Complexity and Impact                                                                                        |

This was all run on Python 3.9.13 64 Bit. In the root directory in terminal, run the following commands in your virtual environment to setup the environment:

- Setup virtualenv
   - `python -m pip install virtualenv venv`
   - `python -m virtualenv venv`
- Activate environemnt
   - `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies
   - `python setup.py install`
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run an example: The following is only an example of how the function can be made, reference the run.py file or use the â€“help command to understand the parameters.
   - For New-Attack-Method: 
     - `python batchrun.py`
   - For MTDSim: 
     - `python -m mtdnetwork.run -m IPShuffle -n 50 -e 10 -s 5 -l 3 results.json`
